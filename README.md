Not long ago we have entered the era of single-page applications. Some people say that we no longer need a server. They say that JavaScript applications can connect to DBMS directly. Fat clients. **We disagree with this.** This project is an attempt to solve the problems of modern fat web.

Korolev runs a single-page application on the server side, keeping in the browser only a bridge to receive commands and send events. The page loads instantly and works fast, because it does a minimal amount of computation. It's important that Korolev provides a unified environment for full stack development. Client and server are now combined into a single app without any REST protocol or something else in the middle.

## Why?

* Lightning-fast page loading speed (~6kB of uncompressed JS)
* Comparable to static HTML client-side RAM consumption
* Indexable pages out of the box
* Routing out of the box
* Build extremely large app without increasing size of the page
* No need to make CRUD REST service
* Connect to infrastructure (DBMS, Message queue) directly from application
* Data security
